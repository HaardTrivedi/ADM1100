                                            The auto industry was established in the late 1800s with the number of
                                            customers increasing annually. At this point, cars have almost become a
                                            necessity for humans in everyday life. However, most cars are still fueled
                                            by gasoline, which is produced from non-renewable resources, and harmful to
                                            the environment when cars use them (as a source of energy) and emit
                                            greenhouse gasses (mostly carbon). In recent years, a major focus of all
                                            companies has been creating cars that have a lesser negative ecological
                                            impact and therefore one of the popular and  “greener” 
                                            solutions to this issue was the introduction of hybrid and electric 
                                            vehicles which are now considered to be the future of the automobile industry.
                                            However, there are currently few problems with why all cars have not completely 
                                            moved to electric vehicle industry yet.<br />

                                            operated.
                                            The rechargeable battery is a major portion of the vehicle as all power is
                                            supplied through this device.</div>

                                        <div class="service-content">
                                            Currently, car batteries are formed primarily of lithium and thus, called
                                            lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, lithium-ion batteries
                                            deteriorate over time.
                                            Additionally, essential minerals in the making of rechargeable
                                            batteries such as praseodymium, lanthanum, dysprosium and
                                            neodymium are rare and injurious to health.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Another material, which can be harmful that is used in production is cobalt.
                                            Cobalt is a major part of the battery but there are ethical issues
                                            surrounding the mining practices utilized to obtain it. 50% of world's
                                            cobalt used is mined
                                            in the Republic of Congo and there are accusations of on-going child labour
                                            practices used for mining. Cobal can be harmful to humans and lead to severe
                                            heart conditions and vision problems.<br />

                                        <div class="service-content">
                                            The term infrastructure alludes to the machinery and locations
                                            required for the electric vehicles to be successful.
                                            Due to its limited mileage - around 500 km - a lot of car
                                            charging locations are required and in frequent occurrence.
                                            There are not enough stations present in the world. Currently,
                                            there are only about 22,000 fast charging stations across the USA and
                                            Canada.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Another hurdle is that the battery charging is very slow. It takes 1hr
                                            25mins to charge from 0%-100% making road trips nearly impossible. The
                                            current batteries do not pack the necessary energy by weight as they
                                            should, making them inefficient. Consumers for electric cars expected to
                                            rise from three million to 125 million by 2030.
                                            The number of locations for power restoration of the
                                            vehicles will have to increase as well as the time taken to charge a car
                                            fully will have to be reduced.

                                            Currently, the number of users of electric cars is increasing at a steady
                                            rate of 22.3% annually. That number may dwindle to 16% with
                                            the decrease in the demand, which would have a negative impact on the economy of
                                            the country as the market would not be profitable.
                                            The job market would also be affected since
                                            the unemployment figures would rise. And the humanitarian crises
                                            would continue without a permanent halt or solution.
