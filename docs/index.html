                                            The auto industry was established in the late 1800s with the number of
                                            customers increasing annually. At this point, cars have almost become a
                                            necessity for humans in everyday life. However, most cars are still fueled
                                            by gasoline, which is produced from non-renewable resources, and harmful to
                                            the environment when cars use them (as a source of energy) and emit
                                            greenhouse gasses (mostly carbon). In recent years, a major focus of all
                                            companies has been creating cars that have a lesser negative ecological
                                            impact and therefore one of the popular and  “greener” 
                                            solutions to this issue was the introduction of hybrid and electric 
                                            vehicles which are now considered to be the future of the automobile industry.
                                            However, there are currently few problems with why all cars have not completely 
                                            moved to electric vehicle industry yet.<br /> <br />

                                            operated.
                                            The rechargeable battery is a major portion of the vehicle as all power is
                                            supplied through this device.</div>

                                        <div class="service-content">
                                            Currently, car batteries are formed primarily of lithium and thus, called
                                            lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, lithium-ion batteries
                                            deteriorate over time.
                                            Additionally, essential minerals in the making of rechargeable
                                            batteries such as praseodymium, lanthanum, dysprosium and
                                            neodymium are rare and injurious to health.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Another material, which can be harmful that is used in production is cobalt.
                                            Cobalt is a major part of the battery but there are ethical issues
                                            surrounding the mining practices utilized to obtain it. 50% of world's
                                            cobalt used is mined
                                            in the Republic of Congo and there are accusations of on-going child labour
                                            practices used for mining. Cobal can be harmful to humans and lead to severe
                                            heart conditions and vision problems.<br />
                                            <br />

                                        <div class="service-content">
                                            The term infrastructure alludes to the machinery and locations
                                            required for the electric vehicles to be successful.
                                            Due to its limited mileage - around 500 km - a lot of car
                                            charging locations are required and in frequent occurrence.
                                            There are not enough stations present in the world. Currently,
                                            there are only about 22,000 fast charging stations across the USA and
                                            Canada.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Another hurdle is that the battery charging is very slow. It takes 1hr
                                            25mins to charge from 0%-100% making road trips nearly impossible. The
                                            current batteries do not pack the necessary energy by weight as they
                                            should, making them inefficient. Consumers for electric cars expected to
                                            rise from three million to 125 million by 2030.
                                            The number of locations for power restoration of the
                                            vehicles will have to increase as well as the time taken to charge a car
                                            fully will have to be reduced.

                                            Currently, the number of users of electric cars is increasing at a steady
                                            rate of 22.3% annually. That number may dwindle to 16% with
                                            the decrease in the demand, which would have a negative impact on the economy of
                                            the country as the market would not be profitable.
                                            The job market would also be affected since
                                            the unemployment figures would rise. And the humanitarian crises
                                            would continue without a permanent halt or solution.

                                                    This new battery technology uses all solid components to deliver power instead of relying on hazardous liquid electrolyte. 
                                                    The solid-state battery offers a greater energy density than traditional lithium-ion batteries without having to increase the size or weight. 
                                                    However, researchers have visualized cracks developing in the interfaces between the materials found in the solid-state battery. 
                                                    A pattern that resembles a web formation began to form on the disk. 
                                                    Another issue that new technology such as the solid-state battery face is the cost of manufacturing this type of battery. 
                                                    Since this battery technology is relatively new, 
                                                    the new parts that compose the solid-state batteries are expensive compared to the lithium-ion battery since the materials used in this battery are still in development.

                                            <div class="service-content">
                                                    The significant flaw in the lithium-ion battery is the use and dependence of cobalt. 
                                                    The next alternative that can solidify the future of electric cars is the minimized usage of cobalt in batteries. 
                                                    This entirely avoids relying on the Democratic Republic of Congo for their unsafe artisanal cobalt mining practices. 
                                                    The batteries found in the Tesla Model 3 are still NCA (Nickel Cobalt Aluminum) batteries however Tesla made significant improvements to the battery to minimize the cobalt usage to less than 3%. 
                                                    LG Chem is developing an NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) battery that consists of an 8:1:1 ratio between nickel, manganese, and cobalt. 
                                                    Not only does this decrease the cost of producing the battery, but the energy density also increases from 300 Wh/kg compared to 265 Wh/kg from the NCA battery. 
                                                    The long term downside to this alternative is the demand of other chemicals such as nickel will begin to increase which will lessen the supply in a shorter amount of time. 
                                                    This is if mining companies cannot address additional demand.

                                        <div class="service-content">
                                                There are many different alternatives that could be assessed to solve the shortcomings of the lithium-ion battery. 
                                                Switching over to developing solid-state batteries all while reducing the cobalt content in the current batteries would help improve our issues with infrastructure and current mining practices. 
                                                The reason that lithium-ion batteries should be improved, 
                                                instead of just focusing on solid-state batteries, 
                                                is because people are impatient and batteries are in high demand.

                                                However, it would not benefit a specific company that decided to switch over to the newly implemented solid state battery. 
                                                The company that would be investing this money into the new battery would hopefully also be the ones distributing the batteries through licenses to other companies. 
                                                Overall a combination of designing a new solid-state battery and switching current lithium-ion batteries in the meantime.

                                            <div class="service-content">
                                                    Manufacturers must find alternatives to completely eliminate cobalt from their batteries, 
                                                    while not compromising on the quality or safety of the product. 
                                                    This would force the government to take action and set strict regulations on the unsafe mining practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
                                                    The manufacturers could also benefit from as they could publicize the fact that their batteries are Cobalt-free, 
                                                    as it may set a good reputation for the company.

                                                    The solid-state battery is one thing that has definitely caught the eye of many companies aiming to build EVs. 
                                                    In order for the Automotive Industry to transition to EV’s, 
                                                    these companies must continue to invest more and more, 
                                                    as this is the future. 
                                                    Solid-state batteries theoretically could store twice as much energy as a lithium-ion battery, 
                                                    and as a result EV’s can travel twice the distance they could with the current lithium-ion batteries, 
                                                    which is one of the main concerns of using EV’s. 
                                                    So in the long-term, investing in R&D of solid-state batteries and successfully building one could revolutionize the automobile industry.

                                                    The main challenge with designing solid state batteries is finding the right material.  
                                                    Dyson - being one of the many companies like Tesla and BMW investing their time and money towards building and using solid-state batteries in their future EV’s, 
                                                    has collectively invested $65 million along with Samsung in Massachusetts-based Ionic Materials to find the right material. 
                                                    The firm claim to be making progress, 
                                                    as they have reportedly discovered that liquid crystal polymer - their new material could address many of the mass-production issues associated solid-state batteries.
